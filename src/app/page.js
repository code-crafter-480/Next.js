ðŸ‘‰ Key Differences :
    Feature                      	<InnerComponent />                    	            {InnerComponent()}
      Lifecycle            Management	React manages lifecycle methods.        	No lifecycle management by React.
      State/Context	       Can use state and context.	                          State and context wonâ€™t work.
      Execution Time	     Executed when React renders it.	                    Executed immediately.
      Reusability          Fully reusable as a React component.                	Behaves like a simple function.
